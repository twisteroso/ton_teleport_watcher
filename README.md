# TON Teleport Watcher

On The Open Network, money doesn't move.  
It **teleports**.

This script sits at the edge of the wormhole and watches when someone pulls **500k+ TON** (~$3M+) into the abyss in a single blink.

No "whale alert".  
No fireworks.  


Just the quiet moment before:

- A new jetton launches with 9-figure liquidity  
- A secret bridge to Ethereum opens  
- An anonymous god buys the entire supply of something  
- Or the money simply ceases to exist in this dimension

```bash
python ton_teleport_watcher.py
